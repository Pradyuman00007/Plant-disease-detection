🌱 Plant Disease Detection System
🚀 A Streamlit-powered web app for detecting plant diseases using Deep Learning. This app allows users to upload images of plant leaves and predicts the disease with a confidence percentage using a trained TensorFlow model.

📌 Features
✅ Upload an image of a plant leaf
✅ AI-powered disease detection
✅ Displays confidence level with a Pie Chart
✅ Interactive and user-friendly UI
✅ Built with Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Plotly
